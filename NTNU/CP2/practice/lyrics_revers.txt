1 Do you hear the people sing?
2 Singing the songs of angry men?
3 It is the music of the people
4 Who will not be slaves again!
5 When the beating of your heart
6 Echoes the beating of the drums
7 There is a life about to start
8 When tomorrow comes!
9 Will you join in our crusade?
10 Who will be strong and stand with me?
11 Somewhere beyond the barricade
12 Is there a world you long to see?
13 Then join in the fight
14 That will give you the right to be free!
15 Do you hear the people sing?
16 Singing the songs of angry men?
17 It is the music of the people
18 Who will not be slaves again!
19 When the beating of your heart
20 Echoes the beating of the drums
21 There is a life about to start
22 When tomorrow comes!
23 Will you give all you can give
24 So that our banner may advance
25 Some will fall and some will live
26 Will you stand up and take your chance?
27 The blood of the martyrs
28 Will water the meadows of France!
29 Do you hear the people sing?
30 Singing the songs of angry men?
31 It is the music of the people
32 Who will not be slaves again!
33 When the beating of your heart
34 Echoes the beating of the drums
35 There is a life about to start
36 When tomorrow comes
